This is just an example runner for my [CI/CD Virtual Lab](https://github.com/mscata/cicdlab) and is NOT 
supposed to be used in any production environment.

Look inside the `Jenkinsfile` to see how to build and test this project.

If you want to build locally, I recommend running this first

```
pip install virtualenv build twine bump
```
